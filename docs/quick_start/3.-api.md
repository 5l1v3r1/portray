# Programmatic Python API Usage

Every command available from the command line utility is also available directly as function calls within Python.
To use the Python API, `import portray` and then call the desired function call:

<script id="asciicast-264254" src="https://asciinema.org/a/264254.js" async></script>

Every function is type hinted and takes and returns only builtin Python objects.

For a full definition of the API see the [API reference documentation](https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/reference/portray/api/).
